# Prerequisites
To run the code and exercises in this repository, you will need to have the followings installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or later)
- Tensorflow (version 2.0 or later)
- Additional dependencies as mentioned in each subdirectory's README file
# Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hasanzeynal/Tensorflow-Developer-Certificate.git
```

2. Navigate to the specific directory for the project or topic you are interested in, e.g., **computer_vision_cnn/** for computer vision and CNN-related projects.

3. Follow the instructions provided in each project's README file to set up the environment and run the code.

# Certification
The **Tensorflow Developer Certificate** is earned by completing the required projects and exercises in this repository and passing the final examination. Each project focuses on practical implementations of deep learning concepts using Tensorflow.
